\section{Algorithms}
  The following sorting algorithms were implemented into my program: 
	\newline QuickSort, InsertionSort, BubbleSort, and SelectionSort. 

\paragraph{Initial Thoughts}
	Knowing the general runtimes of these algorithms, I was not surprised by which ones were faster than others. However, I was shocked by just how different they were. \newline

\section{Data}
For example, here is the time duration for each method sorting through 180,435 numbers:\newline \newline
	BubbleSort:		178.005 seconds\newline
	SelectionSort:	88.8178 seconds\newline
	InsertionSort:	49.1516 seconds\newline
	QuickSort:			1.42191 seconds\newline

\section{Conclusions}
It really is amazing just how much faster QuickSort is compared to other algorithms. It was also shocking to see just how slow BubbleSort is, and how it really is only practicle for small data sets and for quick implementation.
